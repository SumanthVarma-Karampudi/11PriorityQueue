As we discussed that BinaryTree is the best option to implement the priority queue but there are two issues with the BBST
  1.Balancing Factor(maintaining balance while inserting)
  2.Storing values
  
So to avoid these drawbacks, we are not implementing BBST instead we use Heaps:

Heaps property:
  1.Complete Binary Tree - A tree all levels are filled except last level and last level must be filled from left to right
  2.Heap order property - Min heap and Max heap 
   -->Min heap- Root must be less than the two children 
   -->Max heap- Root must be greater than the two children
